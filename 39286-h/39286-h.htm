    <span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p>
    The endeavour of the present work is to fix and develope, for
    the benefit of the Amateur and the Student, some of the
    acknowledged general principles of Colouring as a means of Art,
    without reference to the purposes to which such Art shall be
    applied,&#8212;without reference to poetical expression or character,
    or to the imitation of the details of Nature, which are
    requisite for the production of great works.
</p>

<p>
    And I have much pleasure in being permitted to dedicate it to
    you, who have so recently shown that the capability to execute
    in the higher walks of Art does not depend, as is erroneously
    supposed, upon mechanical skill attained by constant practice
    and devotion to one class of subjects; but upon intellectual
    qualifications and mental refinement, which has ever been
    conspicuous in your treatment of the subjects generally adorned
    by your pencil.
</p>

<p class="indent1">
    I have the honour to remain,
</p>

<p class="indent2">
    Your obedient Servant,
</p>

PREFACE.
</p>


<p>
In the Sketcher's Manual, the general principles of making pictures in
black and white, or, as it is technically termed, in Chiaroscuro, have
been briefly, but it is hoped distinctly, explained. The following work
on Colouring proceeds upon the same method. It treats first of the
arrangements of masses of colours which have been established by
various masters or schools, and which have been recognized as
satisfactory or agreeable by the public voice; it then points out the
abstract principles to which these several arrangements may be
referred; and finally directs attention to the qualities of Colouring
in Art which are requisite as regards the imitation of Nature. It does
not profess to descend to details, for these require a considerable
advance in the Art, and consequently could not possibly be rendered
intelligible in any publication, because they would require the
exercise of first-rate powers, to colour every individual impression of
the plates. For examples of the details of colouring, the Amateur and
the Student must be referred to the best pictures of the several
masters whose general principles are herein exhibited. But it should be
observed, that although the several masters, whose names have been
brought forward in the present work, and in the Sketcher's Manual, as
the originators of the several principles of Chiaroscuro and Colour,
are generally distinguished by some exercise of the principles to which
their names are attached, they have produced many and valuable works in
other and very different styles. It is not intended to imply that all
the works of these masters are constructed upon the same principles;
still less is it intended to imply that the principal merit of these
masters resides in the particular principle of picture-making, which
they have mainly, if not entirely, contributed to develope; for this
would reduce the art of painting to a "mechanical trade," or mere means
of gratifying the eye. Least of all has it been intended to afford to
critics a means of attack upon the modern masters, whose names have
been introduced into these little works, as "painters of pictures on
receipt, or on a principle of manufacture." The development of a new
principle of Art, whether relating to Composition, Chiaroscuro, or
Colour, is as meritorious and worthy of distinction as, if not more so
than, the production of an able work upon the principles of Art
previously established by others.
</p>

<p>
The author is fully sensible that <i>he</i> must submit to criticism
with respect to whatever he may place before the public; nor is he in
the least disposed to complain of any censure of the <i>matter
contained</i> in the works, or of the <i>manner</i> in which that
matter is placed before the public. He can even afford to smile at
the criticism that a work addressed to the <span class="sc">Amateur</span> and the
<span class="sc">Student</span> on Picture-making in Chiaroscuro, "will not make a
Raffaelle or a Titian," particularly as the great merit of the latter
was colouring; and he may observe that he does not expect that even the
present work, which is solely devoted to colouring, "will make a
Titian." It will be sufficient if he shall have placed in a tangible
shape before the reader <i>some</i> of the principles by which the
effects of Colouring, and light and shade have been made, by certain
masters, subservient to higher purposes;&#8212;the Art is but the means to
an end. But the author feels that he has a right to complain of a
criticism of his work, in which the <i>censures</i> of the
<i>critic</i> upon <i>third</i> parties are made to appear to have
proceeded from the author; and he now begs to disclaim having said
anything disrespectful either of Mr. Stanfield or Mr. Roberts, either
directly or indirectly, as will be evident upon the inspection of the
Sketcher's Manual.
</p>

<p>
And the author feels it necessary to remove an erroneous impression
with respect to the nature and intention of these works, by stating,
that they are expressly intended for the Amateur or the Beginner in
Art; that they are not intended to be argumentative or controversial;
nor are any matters introduced that require the support of argument,
evidence, or authority, although these could easily be adduced, if
requisite; but the desire of the author has been to lay before the
Amateur such principles of Art as have received the sanction of years,
and are universally appreciated by the public in their effects: and the
only merit claimed is that of having brought them together in such a
form as to distinguish them clearly; and to render the principles as
evident as possible. But there is no pretension of limiting the whole
Art of Colouring to the principles of Colouring contained herein.
</p>

<p>
For the method in which the plates of the present work have been
executed, I am indebted to a recent improvement in Lithography, made by
Mr. Hullmandell. It is capable of producing more nearly the effects of
painting than any other style of engraving; but from these plates
professing only to represent masses of Colour and general tone, and
being the first that have been attempted in this particular
application, they are not calculated to display Mr. Hullmandell's
improvement to advantage.
</p>




<a name="intro">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="chapter">
INTRODUCTION.
</p>


<p>
Sir Joshua Reynolds in one of his Discourses has stated, that the
Edifice of Art has been gradually raised by the contributions of the
great men of past ages, and that although every addition to knowledge
required the exertion of a mind far in advance of its contemporaries to
effect it, the results have now become the common property of all
artists, and may easily be appropriated by every Student&#8212;"that much
may now be taught, which it required vast genius to discover."
</p>

<p>
It will not be necessary to adduce any argument in support of this
proposition. The difference of opinion will principally refer to "what
part can be taught?" And hereon there have been as great divisions and
disputes as have arisen with regard to the part of the pig that was
forbidden to be eaten by the followers of Mahomet; only it should be
observed that the discussions have terminated in an almost opposite
result; for whereas the whole pig was eaten, scarcely any of the Art
has been taught.
</p>

<p>
Numerous works have been published and numerous methods of instruction
adopted; but they are almost all directed to points of mechanical
execution, or the representation of individual objects, which mainly
depend upon skill.
</p>

<p>
Skill is the natural result of practice or fortunate organization, and
will, of course, differ with the perseverance or capacity of the
student, which has led to the persuasion that the productions of Art
are dependent upon what is called natural genius.
</p>

<p>
But what is <i>known</i> of Art may be as easily communicated as any
other fact, and as easily acquired as a knowledge of history, or any
other appeal to the memory, and is indispensable equally to the critic
and to the amateur. On this subject there are few if any works; and it
is rarely touched by professed teachers of the Art.
</p>

<p>
The method of private tuition at present in favour is, to make a
drawing before the pupil, who is expected to appreciate the course of
proceeding, and to imitate the effect.
</p>

<p>
Watching a drawing thus in progress, it will be observed that the
greater part is done apparently without a thought; it appears to be
literally at the "fingers' ends" of the artist: and this will be found
to comprehend much, it not all that confers the effect of a picture.
But in what does this consist? Repeated practice, and continued study
of works of art, will undoubtedly, <i>in time</i>, bring it to the
"fingers' ends" of the student also, and it will insensibly become an
inexplicable habit, manner or style. But this is, in fact, what may be
taught or communicated in a short time; it is the knowledge resulting
from the experience of ages,&#8212;the edifice built up of discoveries from
time to time contributed to the fund of Art by the success and failures
of our predecessors. This is the <i>knowledge</i> or science of
painting, which should precede all practice or attainment of skill, and
such portion as relates to colouring, it is the intention of the
present work to supply. Skill will follow as a result of the endeavour
to make use of the means to produce the end&#8212;Pictures.
</p>

<p>
There has been, unfortunately, so great confusion in the use of the
terms applicable to Colours, that it becomes difficult to convey any
distinct information respecting them, without hazarding the charge of
pedantry by limiting the signification of certain words. Tints, Tones,
and Shades of Colour have been, and still are, too commonly used so
indiscriminately to mean the same and different things, that no
definite impression can be given, unless there exist a previous
knowledge of the mode in which each word is applied. It will,
therefore, be necessary to explain the meanings with which each word
will be used in the present work.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Tints</span> are those specific and definite qualities of colours, by
which the individuals of a class are distinguished from each other: as
of Reds; Scarlet, Crimson, Pink, Rose-colour, &#38;c.: of Greens;
Apple-green, Olive-green, Pea-green, &#38;c.: of Yellows; Straw-colour,
Amber, &#38;c.: of Blues; Sky-blue, Garter-blue, Indigo, &#38;c.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Shades of Colour</span> imply the degree of brilliancy or depth, as
bright or deep Crimson; light or dark Blue.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Tones of Colour</span> are of more general application, as indicating
the general aspect of classes of Tints or Shades; and especially
designating the degree of warmth or coldness: as cool greens, warm
greys. There may be lighter and darker <i>Shades</i> of the same
<span class="sc">Tone</span>, but not of the same <span class="smc">TINT</span>. Rose-colour and
Crimson may be said to be lighter and darker shades of the same
<i>Tone</i>.
</p>

<p>
The word Tone is also used by itself in opposition to crudity or
rawness of colour; and hence is technically descriptive of the ternary
compounds, of whatever tint or shade; while the primary colours and the
binary compounds, Blue, Red and Yellow, and Purple, Orange and Green,
are technically distinguished as Colour. The lighter shades of Tone in
this sense are technically included under the term <i>Greys</i>; warm,
as they contain Orange; cool, as they contain Purple or Green. Tints
and Tones are further classed as <i>pure</i>, as they approach purple,

Colours are said to be <span class="smc">SUPPORTED</span> by others which present
some resemblance, but are inferior in brilliancy; as blues by purples,

&#8212;<span class="sc">Balanced</span> when by opposition they are so neutralized that no
one appears principal or predominant.
</p>

<p>
The author of a recent publication on Colour is quite in error, when,
in describing technical terms, he states "the Balance of Colouring is
the harmony produced by <i>supporting</i> one colour by <i>another</i>
introduced in <i>different parts</i> of the picture, either <i>of the
same colour</i>, or one approaching to it." This is
<span class="smc">SPREADING</span> <i>a colour</i> <span class="smc">THROUGH</span> the picture,
and though it may <i>contribute</i> to the balance of colouring by
<i>contrasting</i> and <i>neutralizing</i> the <i>other</i> colours in
the work, it is in itself the very opposite of the <i>balance</i> of
<i>colouring</i>, as it consists entirely in loading one side of the
beam. To this it may be added that colours are said to be
<span class="smc">SUPPORTED</span> by similar tints <i>adjacent</i>, and
<span class="smc">ECHOED</span> by them when "in different parts of the picture."
</p>

<p>
There are many other errors in the book above-mentioned, but as this is
not intended to be a controversial disquisition, those mistakes only
will be noticed which might otherwise lead to confusion; but to the
correction.
</p>

<p>
The definition of "<span class="sc">Mellowness</span>," as "caused by those warm
colours which, when blended, produce an agreeable <i>tone</i> or
<i>hue</i>, and would then be said to <i>sympathize</i> and create
<i>harmony</i>," is as incorrect and indefinite, as the remainder of
the paragraph is without foundation:&#8212;"On the contrary, if, in mixing
two or more colours, a disagreeable and harsh effect were produced,
they would be said to have an <i>antipathy</i>, and create
<i>rawness</i>&#8212;this adulteration of one colour by another causes what
painters term a <span class="smc">MUDDY</span> effect." Painters term an effect
<i>muddy</i> when it is dirty in colour and wanting in transparency.
This fancy respecting the sympathy and antipathy of certain colours,
which is more distinctly alluded to in the following passage:&#8212;"when,
to produce a particular tint, the mixing of two colours which do not
sympathize is unavoidable; one or more may be introduced whose sympathy
is greater, that a pleasing and harmonious effect may be produced,
&#38;c."&#8212;this is wholly groundless. How the sympathy and antipathy alluded
to are supposed to act is not very evident, but they have no existence
whatever.
</p>

<p>
The definition of a "<span class="sc">Pearly hue</span>," as "obtained by softening or
blending the <i>warm</i> colours without adulterating one with the
other," is equally liable to objection as untrue.
</p>

<p>
The attempt at a philosophical account of the <i>cause</i> of the
colours produced at sunset and sunrise, has been incidentally exposed
in the third chapter of the present work. This error undoubtedly does
not originate with the professed author of the publication alluded to;
and as the greater part of the book is evidently, though without
acknowledgment, compiled from Mr. Burnett and other writers on the
subject, the other errors are probably in a great measure also the
result of compilation.

COLOURING AS A MEANS OF ART.
</p>


<p>
Colouring is the decorative part of Art. It answers to Rhythm and Rhyme
in poetry, as the means of attracting the senses. As it is a means of
producing, so its indispensable qualification is,&#8212;<span class="smc">BEAUTY</span>.
In the higher aims of Art it should be made subservient to Character
and Expression, by according with the nature of the subject; but, still
under the limitation and regulation of those principles which govern
Pictorial Effect. Under all circumstances, and to whatsoever purposes
applied, the first qualification of Colouring as a means of Art is,
that it should produce a Picture.
</p>

<p>
A picture has been elsewhere defined as an arrangement of one or more
objects and accessories so as to afford an agreeable subject of
Contemplation. And the principles which regulate Chiaroscuro and
general arrangement for this purpose, have been pointed out. The same
principles must regulate Colouring as a means of Art.
</p>

<p>
The mere representation of any object, however accurately detailed and
coloured, does not constitute a picture. It must be represented with
accessories and under Pictorial Effect. This as regards Chiaroscuro has
been shown to depend upon Breadth. As regards Colouring it depends upon
Harmony.

<p class="subhead">
HARMONY.
</p>

<p>
Harmony is a term borrowed from the sister Art of Music, to denote a
degree of relation or congruity between two or more colours, so as
mutually to support or develope each other's beauties, as is the case
with a chord or concord of sounds. The degrees of relation, or
qualification for harmony, of sounds, can be ascertained by
mathematical calculation incapable of erroneous results. Not so, those
of Colours; at least in the present state of the science of Optics. If
it should be proved that colours are the effect of vibrations of the
air, or any other fluid, as are sounds, the Harmony of Colours may
equally become the subject of mathematical calculation, with equally
certain results; at present we cannot go beyond rude approximations by
guess or supposition; and are vaguely placed under the regulation of
<i>Taste</i>, itself as Protean and undefined.
</p>

<p>
The theory of the three or seven colours being all equally necessary to
each other, which has been derived from the division of the ray of
light by a prism, has been supposed to afford the relative proportions
of the various tints necessary to Harmony in a picture, <i>because
existing in light</i>; and fanciful, but entirely unfounded, analogies
have been drawn by enthusiasts between the seven colours and the seven
notes, and the three colours and the notes of the common chord in
music: but without going into the question of how far this would be
likely to assist in our present inquiry, <i>if true</i>, it may be
sufficient to observe that these relative proportions <i>vary</i> with
the substance of the prism by means of which the ray of light is
divided; so that the whole induction falls to the ground.
</p>

<p>
But were the proportions always the same, the induction would be
equally untenable. For, though light may be very beautiful; and the
Rainbow may be very beautiful; a totally different kind of beauty is
required for a picture. The colours of the Rainbow may perfectly
harmonize; but it is more than doubtful whether the person whose whole
picture was a representation of a Rainbow, would be considered to have
produced a finely coloured work of Art.
</p>

<p>
Harmony, in Pictorial Colour, does not depend upon any particular
proportionate quantities of the different tints; nor in any particular
disposition or arrangement of them; but upon the qualities and the
treatment of the individual colours. A picture may be painted with
every variety of the most brilliant colours; or, on the other hand, as
Rembrandt treated light, the work may contain only one small spark of
colour, the remainder being made up of neutral tints; and even the
small spark of colour may be dispensed with, and the whole picture be
made up of a variety of tones.
</p>

<p>
Having dwelt so much in the Sketcher's Manual, upon the principle of
Breadth being indispensable for the production of Pictorial Effect, it
will scarcely be requisite to point out that it is equally necessary
that Colours should be so treated as to produce <i>Unity</i>; and that,
as with lights and shadows, so whatever variety of tints may be
introduced into a picture, they must be so blended and incorporated
with each other, that they still form parts of a whole;&#8212;that whether
the lights be white, and the shadows black, or differently coloured,
the same necessity for graduation remains; so that Colours must not be
in flat patches. And in the treatment of Colours, besides the
graduation requisite for Breadth of Chiaroscuro, it is necessary to pay
attention to the peculiar quality termed <span class="sc">Tone</span>, which is
indispensable in a coloured Work of Art.
</p>

<p>
As well as Breadth of Chiaroscuro, there must be <span class="sc">Breadth of
Tone</span>, the fundamental quality of Harmony.

<p class="subhead">
TONE.
</p>

<p>
This is a term also borrowed from the vocabulary of Music, to denote a
property or quality of Colour, the opposite of gaudiness or harshness;
and implies a richness or sobriety, inviting quiet contemplation. It
confers what is technically termed <i>repose</i>. It bears that
relation to colours in general, that the quality of a musical note does
to that of an unmusical sound or mere noise. In Music, this is known to
depend upon the vibrations of the air being <i>isochronous</i>, or at
regular intervals. Should it be discovered that Colours are also
produced by vibrations, Tone in its present application may prove to
arise from a similar regularity.
</p>

<p>
Tone implies a degree of transparency, which in Oil colours is
attainable with great facility, by a process termed <i>glazing</i>;
viz. passing a transparent colour over a previously prepared tint.
There are also some other practical methods of producing it, which are
more advisable in certain cases, but which need not be further noticed
here. In Water colours, the greater number of pigments used are
transparent, and the legitimate method of using them proceeds upon the
principle of working entirely in transparent media; which has, at all
times, excited great hopes with regard to that branch of Art, as
affording a better means than Oil colours (in which the light tints are
all composed with opaque white) of producing the brilliancy and truth
of Nature, in combination with the transparency (tone) which is
required in a work of Art. And it is to be regretted, that in some few,
and those popular instances, this advantage arising out of the
legitimate use of Water colours, should have been thrown away, without
obtaining any equivalent, other than that of hiding or correcting
blunders; and that attempts should have been made, by the use of opaque
body colours, and a similar method of working, to imitate the effect of
Oil painting. The progress of the true art of Water-colour drawing,
must necessarily receive a check from the adoption of such a practice,
which will doubtless be sanctioned by the idle or the hurried; and
attempts to carry out the original prospects and genuine advantages of
the transparent medium, will probably become rare, if they should not
cease entirely.
</p>

<p>
It is true that opaque Water-colours are supposed to have an advantage
over Oil-colours, in light and brilliant parts, in consequence of the
tendency of the Oil (the <i>vehicle</i>, as it is technically termed)
to come to the surface, and thus to give a tinge to, or obscure, the
purer tints of skies and distant brilliant objects. On this account,
they are said to be used by Turner in these parts, when he desires to
attain great clearness and purity of colour. But, however, the
<i>union</i> of Water-colours with Oil may be advantageous for these
purposes, and thus <i>Opaque</i> Water-colours may receive a partial
sanction; it cannot be denied that, in the instances previously alluded
to, in which the Opaque Water-colours are used for no other purpose
than the facility of recovering half-tints that had been too much
obscured, the only advantage of Water-colours is abandoned, without
obtaining the equivalent of <i>richness</i>, arising from texture in
Oil; and the purity of the one art is lost, without attaining the force
of the other. A crumbly, bungling appearance is produced, and for no
reason, as the practice can never be successfully employed in the parts
or objects, in which the use of semi-transparent colours is so
invaluable in Oil. And in fact, Opacity, the reverse of what is
desired, Tone, is produced by the very same means in Water-colours, by
which transparency is attained in Oil.
</p>

<p>
Breadth of Tone is obtained by a process termed <i>breaking the
colours</i>, which is the same with the method of incorporating lights
with each other, described in the Sketcher's Manual; viz. graduating
each tint into those adjacent, by which means a certain degree of
affinity is diffused throughout the whole picture, and Harmony, or
Breadth of Tone, is produced. The same results are effected, by a
process perhaps abused in the present day, termed Glazing, which
consists in passing some transparent pigment of the tone desired, over
the whole picture, and thus breaking all the tints in the work with the
same colour which produces the affinity required.

RULES FOR PRODUCING PICTURES IN COLOUR.
</p>


<p>
Although Harmony or Pictorial Colouring does not <i>depend</i> upon any
<i>particular</i> quantities or arrangement of <i>particular</i> tints,
as the slightest consideration of the infinite variety of Pictures that
have been produced will prove; certain quantities and arrangements of
certain colours, have been found to effect it.
</p>

<p>
These discoveries have been made from time to time, and have each been
adopted as principles by different artists; and though admitting of
considerable variation in details, their effects have been so evidently
distinguished by the public as uniform in general aspect, that they
have been ranged in classes or schools, to one of which any individual
work is instantly referred, by those who have even a slight
acquaintance with the Art.
</p>

<p>
By <i>writers</i> upon Art it has been very generally contended, that
there <i>must</i> be a balance of warm and cold colours. A little
consideration will show, that this, as well as <i>all</i> restrictive
regulations, such as that blue must not come in the front of the
picture, &#38;c. are unfounded, or nearly the whole of the Dutch school of
landscape and interiors must be condemned as wanting in Harmony, or bad
colourists; for Ruysdael and Hobbima, Teniers and Ostade, seem to have
had a horror of warm colours, while, on the other hand, Cuyp and Both
seem to have had an equal dread of cool tints. That a balance of warm
and cold colour is <i>one</i> principle by which Pictorial Harmony may
be obtained, is perfectly true; and that there are various means of
balancing them is also true; which affords numerous varieties of style
or character of pictures. And that the principle deduced by Sir Joshua
Reynolds from the Venetian school, that one-third of the picture should
(may) be cool, and the remaining two-thirds warm, is also just; and
will be productive of beautiful results. The error consists in making
these relative proportions <i>indispensable</i> to Harmony.
</p>

<p>
This chapter will contain such principles as have been found to ensure
Harmony. There may, perhaps, be many others in store for future
discovery.
</p>

<p>
These principles are of universal application, whatever objects may be
the subject of the drawing or picture, whether landscape, figures,
animals, flowers, or altogether; and they are wholly independent of
Poetical or Dramatic colouring,&#8212;the application of colour to
Expression and Character,&#8212;and of the colouring of individual objects.
</p>

<p>
The art of composition, in regard to colour, consists in arranging
objects in such a manner, that their true colouring will produce the
combination required by the principle adopted. The art of too many of
the artists of the present day, consists in introducing the colours
required, without any reference to their being found in nature or not.

<p class="subhead">
CUYP'S PRINCIPLE.
</p>

<p>
The simplest arrangement and treatment of Colours will be found in the
style of Cuyp and Both; objects in shadow are relieved against a warm
sunny sky. For the reasons given in the Sketcher's Manual, with regard
to Progressive Execution, these are the best adapted to beginners;
objects in shadow do not present much variety of tint.
</p>

<p>
The whole aspect or general tone of the picture is warm. The shadows
are cooler than the lights, but very far from cold; being of a Sepia
brown, and sometimes warmer, with some cool reflections from the air.
The sky is gently graduated from a rich yellow to the most delicate
warm grey. The middle ground affords some blackish-green half-tints or
shadows; and some golden lights are introduced in front.
</p>

<p>
Cuyp treated figures, animals, and boats in this way. The points
requiring attention and care are, first, the tone of the sky and yellow
lights, which must be obtained from yellow and Roman ochres; the sky
should have a creamy quality of colour; and what little grey is
introduced, must be Cobalt Blue, or Ultramarine with Carmine, or Lake,
so as to prevent the slightest appearance of green; secondly, the
masses of shadow must be of agreeable shape and must not be too dark.

BOTH'S PRINCIPLE.
</p>

<p>
The style of Both is only a slight variation from that of Cuyp. He
adopted a different character of subject, usually contriving to relieve
a mass of rock or bank, and a tree with delicate foliage against the
sky; and he increased the warmth of the general aspect of the picture,
by making the tree and part of another <i>light</i> bank, of the rich
brown afforded by burnt Terra de Sienna, and by introducing some red
clouds in the sky. In some instances Both has not escaped the dangers
that present the difficulty to his followers; the tone of these
pictures appears hot, and thereby a vulgarity is occasioned, and that
refinement which is required by Taste in the Fine Arts, is destroyed.

HOBBIMA AND RUYSDAEL'S PRINCIPLES.
</p>

<p>
These masters have adopted a style which, though apparently as opposite
to that of Cuyp and Both as cold is to warm, resembles it in this
respect&#8212;they rarely, if ever, admit positive colours in force, and
thus offer another simple principle for the treatment and arrangement
of tints.
</p>

<p>
In Hobbima and Ruysdael, who painted landscapes, dark brownish masses
are relieved against a cloudy grey sky, and some white or grey light is
introduced in front to carry the colour of the sky through the work.
The general aspect of the picture is cold. What little warmth of tone
may be admitted, is to be found in the centre of the shadows; and the
only approximation to positive colour, is in the sky, a little cold
feeble blue, obtained in water-colours from Indigo; and a small portion
of a deeper shade of the same tone of blue on mountains or trees in
shadow in the distance; or a little cold green in the middle ground. If
ever any red be introduced, it must be a mere speck of vermilion shaded
with grey, to give value by contrast to the neutral tones, which make
up the principle part of the picture. Plate.

Teniers and Ostade have treated homely interiors upon the same
principle, making up the greater part of the picture with brownish grey
tones, and introducing in the light, some very feeble spots of the
primary colours, carefully shaded with grey, to assimilate them with
the general aspect of the work. What little warmth is admitted, is
found in the shadows and reflections, as in the productions of Ruysdael
and Hobbima. But the lights afford a greater purity of tone; so that
while the works of Ruysdael and Hobbima would be said to have a grey
tone, Teniers, and particularly Ostade, are said to have a silvery
tone. Plate.

THE PRINCIPLES OF TITIAN AND THE VENETIAN SCHOOL.
</p>

<p>
The Venetian School, founded by Titian, adopted a combination of rich
warm browns, yellows, and greens, supported by crimsons, all deep in
tone, overspreading two-thirds of the picture, opposed by very rich,
almost warm, blues, and animated by a point of white, sometimes
accompanied by black in the front of the subject. No violent contrasts
are admitted, no crude colours. The white is toned down to assimilate
with flesh tints, which are again toned to accord with golden lights,
gradually deepening into yellowish browns, and emerging through warm
greens to join the blues, which are kept in check by the opposition in
some places to rich reddish browns of the same relative shade, so that
one shall not be darker than the other; the blue is graduated as it
approaches the white, into which it is blended by the interposition of
fleshy-coloured tints. The whole aspect of the picture is rich and
warm, but subdued. The lights are golden and the shadows brown, with
just so much cool green, white, and blue, as shall prevent the picture
appearing rusty. But though these tints are called cool, because they
are cooler than the rest of the work, as in the style of Cuyp and Both,
they must not be cold; but above all it is requisite to take care that
they are not crude. White must be toned with yellow or red; blue must
incline to purple; and if black be introduced, it must not be
<i>blue</i> black. Plate.

LUDOVICO CARACCI'S PRINCIPLE.
</p>

<p>
Ludovico Caracci followed the Venetian school, but subdued the colours
of the whole picture, to what Sir Joshua Reynolds calls a "cloistered
tone," the effect of a "dim religious light, through storied pane."
Neither white nor black are admitted: the deepest shadows do not
descend below a rich brown; the brightest lights do not rise above a
creamy yellow. The blue is no longer opposed to a brown of the same
relative shade, but is introduced in the half-lights, and carefully
blended into the shadows, by means of warm reflections, and the
interposition of reddish purple shadows. The Chiaroscuro is broader and
more tranquil than in the works of the Venetian school. Plate.

ANOTHER PRINCIPLE OF TITIAN.
</p>

<p>
Titian has adopted another principle in the painted ceiling of the Hall
of Judgment, in the Ducal palace at Venice. Pure greys are interspersed
amongst masses of bright crimson, which are opposed to some pure white
and blue, broken by flesh tints. The reds and greys are supported by
some warm yellows, and the whole assimilated by rich brown shadows. The
contrasts of colour and Chiaroscuro are vivid, and require care in the
shapes, as well as the situations of the masses and points of relief.
Plate.
</p>

<p>
This principle of colouring is applicable to gorgeous historical
subjects, portraits, and flowers. Sir Thomas Lawrence frequently
adopted it with a slight variation, resulting from the combination of
some portion of the following principle which was developed by Rubens.

RUBENS' PRINCIPLE.
</p>

<p>
Rubens is the founder of another school in which the most violent
contrasts of colour and Chiaroscuro are admitted in the focus of the
picture. The deepest black, supported by rich yellows, crimsons, and
blues, is opposed to the brightest vermilion, sometimes heightened with
gold, and the purest white, which is graduated through every variety of
pearly tint into bright blues, interspersed with purply greys, creamy
and fleshy half-tints.
</p>

<p>
Great simplicity of Chiaroscuro is requisite in this style of
colouring. Both the white and the black must graduate uninterruptedly
into the half-lights, which form the greater part of the picture. The
crimsons, blues, and yellows, that support the black, must all partake
of the same tone. The vermilion must graduate into purply tints, which
will emerge through greys and greens to the bright blue. Plate.

Turner has controverted the old doctrine of a balance of colours, by
showing that a picture may be made up of delicately graduated blues and
white, supported by pale cool green, and enlivened by a point of rich
brownish crimson. It requires some care in the graduation and shapes of

ANOTHER PRINCIPLE OF TURNER.
</p>

<p>
Another principle adopted by Turner is, to contrast rich autumnal
yellows in the foreground, with a brilliant Italian blue sky, graduated
through a series of exquisitely delicate pearly tints, to meet the
cooler green tints of the middle ground. The warm colours in the
foreground are qualified by purply half-tints, and supported by warm
shadows and some rich crimsons; or sometimes reduced to comparative
sobriety by the opposition of the brightest orange and white. Plate.

MODERN MANNER.
</p>

<p>
A very favourite manner of the present day is partially to relieve a
tower, steeple, spire, or some upright object, rendered of a purple
colour, against a white cloud which is graduated with purply greys,
creamy and fleshy tints, and opposed to some bright patches of blue;
the lower part of the building or object is graduated through cool
greens or greys, into some warmer yellows or browns in the foreground,
which are interspersed with points of bright colours, such as Cobalt
blue, Vermilion, Lake, and sometimes white and black, but always
introducing in front some dull red, as of bricks or tiles, contrasted
with fresh greys. Plate.

<p class="subhead">
ABSTRACT PRINCIPLES TO WHICH THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE REFERRED.
</p>

<p>
These several styles of colouring may be reduced to certain abstract
principles, which may be made the foundation for other and different
arrangements, as the taste and talent of the artist or amateur may
dictate.
</p>

<p>
Pictures may be made up of a balance, or harmonic arrangement of
<span class="sc">Tones</span>.
</p>

<p>
Or, of a balance, or harmonic arrangement of <span class="sc">Colours</span>.
</p>

<p>
Or, of a balance, or harmonic arrangement of <span class="sc">Tones</span> and
<span class="sc">Colours</span>.
</p>

<p>
Or, by relieving a <span class="smc">SPARK</span> of <span class="smc">COLOUR</span> against a mass
of <span class="smc">TONES</span>.
</p>

<p>
Or, by relieving a spot of black or white, <i>the concentration of</i>
<span class="smc">TONES</span>, against a general aspect of <span class="smc">COLOURS</span>.
</p>

<p>
Pictures may be warm in tone, qualified by so much cool tint as will
prevent their appearing hot.
</p>

<p>
Or cool, with so much warm tint as will prevent their appearing cold.
</p>

<p>
A small spark of bright colour will balance a large mass of subdued
tint. Equal brightness will require equal masses.
</p>

<p>
For the principles by which the shapes and situations of masses and
points must be governed, the reader is referred to the Sketcher's
Manual, where they will be found at length, and carefully illustrated.
The same regulations that govern the distribution of several lights or
shadows, must guide the positions of several masses of the same colour.
If two or more are introduced, they must not be equal in size, nor
similar in shape, nor must they be so placed, that a line drawn through
them, would be either horizontal or vertical&#8212;parallel with either base
or side. The great principle of colouring being Variety within the
limits of Harmony, such masses of similar tints should be of different
sizes and shapes, and should be interspersed at different distances
through the picture, so as to suggest an undulating line, traversing
all, or at least three, of the four quarters of the picture, that all
the particular colour shall not be on one side, and none on the other,
nor all at the lower, and none in the upper half of the picture. But if
the arrangement of relieving a spark of colour against a mass of tones,
or the reverse be adopted, it must not be placed in the centre of the
picture, nor equidistant from either top and base, or the two sides.
</p>

<p>
With regard to the beauty of individual tints, it would be difficult to
come to any very strict definition, as what is pleasing to one person,
is not so to another; and particularly in reference to the use of
colours in Art, for they then become so dependent upon the other tints
by which they are surrounded, that they may be said to cease to have
positive designations, and to become only comparative; and there is
scarcely any tint, however disagreeable in itself, but may be made by
Art to appear agreeable, if not beautiful. But the object of the
present work being to collect the certain or decided principles of Art,
for the benefit of those who desire to derive pleasure or amusement
from it, the doubtful or questionable hypotheses will be left
untouched, and those points only brought forward which are calculated
to ensure success.
</p>

<p>
For this purpose, the amateur should avoid greenish blues and greenish
yellows; they both appear sickly: and never place such a green between
blue and yellow as would result from the mixture of the particular
tints of those two colours which are made use of.
</p>

<p>
Both blue and yellow become agreeable as they incline to red. Red
becomes rich as it inclines to blue, brilliant as it inclines to
yellow. All shades and tones of purple or orange are agreeable; but of
greens, those only which incline to yellow. Blueish greens require
either to be very pale, as shown in Turner's first principle (<i>See
Plate</i>), or moderated with black, so as almost to cease to be
colours, and become tones. All shades and tints of the tertiary
compounds are agreeable in their places; they receive value by the
opposition of the colour which enters least into their composition, and
become difficult to manage only when they approach full blueish green.
</p>

<p>
White and black give value to all colours and tones.
</p>

<p>
It may be necessary to make an observation upon the foregoing warning,
and almost proscription, of the use of green in Art, as that colour is
found to be exceedingly agreeable in Nature, and is used with success
in manufactures, and for other general purposes. It is found to afford
great relief to weak sight, and is abstractedly so much admired, that
it appears singular and paradoxical to say, that green must be
sparingly used in pictures, even in landscapes, whose greatest charm in
nature consist of luxuriance of vegetation: but such is the case. The
general tone of a picture may be yellow, as in the works of Cuyp, Both,
Ludovico Caracci (<i>see Plates</i>); red, as in the second principle
of Titian (<i>see Plate</i>); blue, as in the first principle of Turner
(<i>see Plates</i>); grey or brown, as in the works of Ruysdael and the
Dutch School (<i>see Plates</i>); but a green picture, however true to
nature, instantly excites an universal outcry as being disagreeable;
and if any of the modern school, to which we shall presently advert,
have been for a moment tolerated, it has arisen from the previous great
reputation of the artist, or for other merits in the work, and in
<i>spite</i> of its being a green picture.
</p>

<p>
The following hypothesis <i>may</i> be the mode of accounting for this
paradox, and, at the same time, <i>may</i> throw some light upon
another, which will be noticed; that although painting is an imitative
art, imitation, to the extent of deception, does not constitute its
highest excellence.
</p>

<p>
The eye is excited by Colour, and the object of painting, independent
of poetical expression or character, is to excite the eye agreeably.
But green is found to excite the eye <i>less</i> than any other tint,
(thereby affording some corroboration to the idea that, strictly
speaking, its opposite red, is the only true <i>colour</i>,) not even
excepting black; so that it acts as an opiate, and is used for
counteracting the brightness of the sun, by means of parasols or
glasses, and to guard weak eyes from the effects of light by means of
silk shades.
</p>

<p>
It is thrown out as a suggestion that, in looking at a picture in which
excitement to the degree of pleasure is <i>expected</i>, a
disappointment <i>may</i> arise from finding a prevalence of those
tints which do not excite, except to a very slight extent, and that
<i>thus</i> a green picture <i>may</i> occasion dissatisfaction. In
looking at Nature we do not wish to be always excited, and green is
admired or valued as affording repose; but in looking at a picture, the
very object is excitement, within certain limits, which green has a
tendency to destroy.
</p>

<p>
Certain tints of green become disagreeable in certain parts of
pictures, from association of ideas. Green in flesh, excites the idea
of corruption and decay. Green in skies, occasioned by blending the
warm yellows of sunset with the blue, excite the impression of want of
skill to prevent the one tint running into the other.
</p>

<p>
But in reservation it must be repeated, that there is no tint that
cannot be controlled and made available, by great skill and management,
to the purposes of Art. These warnings are for beginners and amateurs;
and the work is intended to show them what they may do with safety; as
they attain proficiency, they may attempt difficulties, which
principally reside in <i>truth</i> of detail <i>in combination</i> with
agreeable general effect. When to this is added a just subservience to
Poetical Character, the greatest requisitions of the Art have been
complied with; all other difficulties, of whatever nature, being merely
a species of mountebank trickery, beneath the aim of high Art, and
deserving of the well-known sarcasm of Dr. Johnson upon some difficult
music, that "he wished it were impossible."

FINE COLOURING.
</p>


<p>
Having shown in the preceding chapters certain principles upon which
Pictorial arrangements of Colours may be ensured, the attention of the
reader must be directed to what other qualities are requisite to
constitute Fine Colouring.
</p>

<p>
Fine Colouring must not be confounded with Fine Colours. Some of the
Finest Colourists have avoided Fine Colours, and Sir Joshua Reynolds
adduces as a <i>proof</i> that Apelles was a Fine Colourist, the
statement by Pliny, that, "after he had finished his pictures, he
passed an <i>atramentum</i>, or blackness, over the whole of them."
</p>

<p>
Nor is truth of imitation sufficient of itself to constitute Fine
Colouring, though it always confers a value on a work of Art.
</p>

<p>
Fine Colouring, in the higher walks of Art, implies an adaptation of
the general aspect or style of colouring to the expression and
character of the subject; it then acquires the title of Poetical
Colouring, which is its highest commendation as a means of Art.
</p>

<p>
But, independent of subject, there are other abstract qualifications of
Fine Colouring to be sought for, in the representation of objects. It
not only requires such an arrangement of tints and tones as shall
produce an agreeable whole, but descends to minuti&#230;, and demands that
such tints and tones, shall be obtained by a degree of refinement or
idealization, within probability, of the ordinary appearances of
Nature, or by a selection of the greatest beauties she displays, and
such a combination of them as shall contribute to convey the most
pleasing impressions, and present <i>her</i> under the most attractive
aspect.

<p class="subhead">
PRINCIPLES OF COLOURING OBJECTS.
</p>

<p>
Proceeding to consider Colouring independently of Character or
Expression, to which it should be subservient in the higher walks of
Art, the attention of the reader must be directed to a circumstance
connected with truth of representation.
</p>

<p>
It has commonly been the practice, under the almost universal sanction
of great authorities, to place the student who may be desirous of
acquiring the Art of Painting, before some object, and to direct him to
copy <i>what he sees</i>. But what does he see?
</p>

<p>
We need not go into the question of <i>how</i> impressions are produced
upon the mind, through the medium of the eye; whether a species of
picture of the object be, during the inspection, as it were painted
upon the retina; and whether that be inverted or anywise different from
the real object; or whether, and to what extent, association rectifies
the imperfections of our sight. These, and other investigations into
the philosophical and physical nature of vision, may be left to the
consideration of those who desire to account for particular facts; we
have to do with the facts themselves.
</p>

<p>
In whatever manner the effect may be produced, it is indisputable, that
a certain and distinct impression is produced upon the mind, through
the medium of the eye, by every object which may be before it, and that
impression has a strict relation to the real character of the object;
for instance, a marble statue, it appears, or an impression is conveyed
of, an object of one unvaried tint. How this impression is conveyed, is
of no consequence; it is conveyed; and a series of tints may be
artificially arranged upon paper (or any other convenient material), so
as also, if not equally, to convey to the mind the impression of a
marble statue of uniform whiteness. But upon examination of the drawing
or painting, it would be seen, that scarcely any two parts of the
<i>representation</i> of the statue were of exactly the same tint. Some
parts would be delicately graduated from a point of light, through a
series of darker tints, to give the appearance of roundness; while
others would be made nearly black by shadow, to give the appearance of
projection. The present enquiry has reference solely to Colours, but
the same difficulties occur with regard to forms.
</p>

<p>
Here there is a discrepancy, occasioned by Association, which we shall
scarcely find language to explain, but which will in most cases prove
of serious perplexity to the student; for there are some other persons
like Queen Elizabeth, who have no idea of shadow, unless it be the
shadow of a parasol or tree, under which they may escape the intensity
of a noon-day sun. The statue will appear, or an impression will be
conveyed to the mind, of uniform whiteness. But pictorially speaking,
one spot only, that which reflects the greatest light, will appear
quite white. All the other parts will <i>appear</i>, that is, to convey
the impression, they must be made, of an infinite variety of tints,
from the brightest light to the deepest shadow. The statue <i>is</i>
actually uniformly white, and it appears uniformly white, yet the
<i>appearance</i> or representation which must be put upon paper, to
convey an impression of that <i>appearance</i> by drawing or painting,
is totally opposite, being an infinite variety of tints.
</p>

<p>
But in a statue, by reason of its convexity, the second species of
<i>appearance</i>, the Pictorial, is much more readily appreciated,
from the strong opposition of light and shadow, than in a flat
surface,&#8212;a ceiling, a pavement, or meadow, in which the perception of
the modifications of colour, arising from what is termed aerial
perspective, is considerably influenced, by the Association above
mentioned, until the eye has become educated to observe these minute
and delicate gradations of tint. Thus, in looking at a meadow, we know
the grass to be generally of the same colour throughout, and to an
uneducated eye it <i>appears</i> equally green from one end to the
other: or the ceiling of a well lighted room, we know it to be of one
colour throughout, and it <i>appears</i> of one even tint from the
nearest to the most distant extremity; yet pictorially speaking, it
<i>appears</i> of an infinite variety of tints, for the effect of the
atmosphere is such as to rob the grass of its colour, and to make the
white ceiling grey, as they recede from the eye.
</p>

<p>
It will scarcely be necessary to guard against misconception as to the
use of the terms describing the effect of the atmosphere, by explaining
that it is not intended to assert that an <i>actual change</i> takes
place, or that there is any <i>actual</i> difference in the colour of
those parts of objects which are at a distance from the eye; or, that
the colour in the distance does not appear to be, as we know it is, the
same with that nearest the eye; but that the effect of distance is the
<i>pictorial appearance</i> of a modification of tint, by the
interposition of the atmosphere, perceptible only to an educated eye.
</p>

<p>
We know the grass to be equally green throughout, and it appears of the
tints which convey that impression; while Association conceals the
modification occasioned by the interposition of the atmosphere (which
the generality of observers consider as only "air," and of no
consequence), and excites the notion that the meadow appears of one
equal flat tint. But the distant extremity of the meadow is seen
through more or less atmosphere, which is more or less dense; and in
proportion to its density will the colour of the grass be
<i>apparently</i> altered or changed thereby; and in some instances, as
in case of a fog, entirely concealed.
</p>

<p>
In looking at any object through a perfectly transparent medium, such
as plate glass, we do not perceive any alteration in the real colours.
But when the medium is not perfectly transparent, which is the case
with the atmosphere, the colours of all objects seen through it are
modified or tinged in proportion to its density, until they are
sometimes lost or absorbed in the tint of the medium.
</p>

<p>
The slightest possible colourless opacity gives a medium approaching to
a whitish film, which is very evident when there is light behind it; as
in the case of the beams of the moon. This is the clearest state of the
atmosphere. As it increases in density, it becomes more and more white,
until it becomes a white mist, fog or cloud. The atmosphere is
sometimes coloured, as will hereafter be mentioned; at present we have
to do with its colourless state.
</p>

<p>
The opacity of the atmosphere, as a white film over the darkness of
space, occasions the blue appearance of the sky; and in proportion to
the rarity or density of the medium, is the intensity of colour, or
rather depth of tone. If the atmosphere be extremely rare, as in the
Polar regions, or at the height of Mont Blanc, the sky appears almost
black. And if the atmosphere be thick with vapour, the sky assumes a
milky colour, and the blue tint is lost in that of the medium. When the
atmosphere is just so rare as to be scarcely perceptible in its
influence upon terrestrial objects,&#8212;as in Italy, or the eastern
climes, where the most distant buildings appear diminished in size, but
almost as distinct as those close to the spectator,&#8212;yet sufficiently
dense to become a veil to the expanse of space, the colour of the sky
appears the most intense blue. As near as we can superficially
ascertain it,&#8212;in the exact medium between such rarity of atmosphere as
would afford blackness, and such opacity as would afford whiteness,&#8212;we
may expect to find the most intensely blue colour in the sky.
</p>

<p>
As the effect of this colourless opacity of the atmosphere is, to
render the appearance of the <i>darkness of space</i> a blue colour, so
all dark terrestrial objects are similarly affected by the intervening
of this medium, and, in a corresponding degree, become more or less
blue. The dark mountains in Wales and Scotland appear of a deep blue,
sometimes verging upon purple; and a slight comparison between the
colour of the trees close to the spectator and those in the distance,
will show how much more blue the latter become, from the influence of
the medium through which they are viewed.
</p>

<p>
And as objects, in proportion to their distance, are more or less
affected by the interposition of the atmosphere, so, also, do the parts
of the individual objects themselves, become more or less grey as they
recede. The boundaries of a white object are less white, and of a black
object less black, than the parts nearest the eye. A tree is most green
at the prominent parts, and greyer at the top and sides.
</p>

<p>
This truth is so decidedly felt by the public in general&#8212;though
perhaps insensibly appreciated and but tacitly acknowledged,&#8212;that, as
the atmosphere reduces the colours of all objects to a blue tint, so
all blue colours convey an impression of distance, and all tints
approaching to blue are accordingly designated <i>retiring colours</i>.
</p>

<p>
But the atmosphere is not always colourless. The rays of the sun tinge
it with yellow. The rays from a fire or candle tinge it with a colour
approaching to red. The combination of smoke tinges it with black or
brown; and fogs infuse various degrees of dingy yellow. All these
variations affect the colours of the objects seen through the
atmosphere, and modify the degree of blue, or quality of grey, tint
communicated thereby.
</p>

<p>
When the atmosphere is coloured by the light of the sun, the blue is
modified, more or less, into a warm grey. But owing to the brilliancy
resulting from the blaze of light, the tints remain of the utmost
purity. All tendency to green is kept in subordination by the pearly
tints of those parts which are in shadow. The atmosphere is rendered
more dense at the same time that it is coloured by the light of the
sun; but the light parts of the objects seen through it are rendered,
by the same cause, so much more brilliant, that the density of the
medium is partially compensated; while its full effect is apparent upon
the shadows seen through it, over which a bright haze diffuses a
beautiful blue tint, slightly warmed by the golden colour of the
illuminating power. The contrast of the yellow tinge in the lights
makes these shadows appear to incline to purple; and at sunset and
sunrise, when by the greater quantity of the medium, rendered more
dense by the aqueous vapours close to the earth, the colour of the
sun's light is enriched to a deep golden hue approaching orange and
red, the shadows assume a decidedly purple tint, of which the blue is
supplied by the density, and the red by the colour, of the medium. As
the light of the sun decreases, the colour of the atmosphere is more
evidently tinged with red, until the sun has sunk so far below the
horizon, that the shadows of night incorporating with the colour of the
vapours, render them a dull grey, sometimes approaching a brown.
</p>

<p>
In proportion as the atmosphere is illumined does it also become
opaque. The sky close to the sun appears much less blue than on the
opposite side of the heavens. The beams of the sun, or moon, or even
the rays of a candle, become so opaque, as absolutely to conceal all
objects behind them.
</p>

<p>
In a glowing sunshine, the particles of the atmosphere loaded with
light, produce that soft haze or <i>caligine</i>, "as the Italian hath
it," by which the colours of every object seen through it, are
assimilated in one broad, warm, grey tone, however varied the tints of
the objects in reality may be.
</p>

<p>
Another singular appearance takes place in remote objects, of which no
one has so fully availed himself as Turner, for the production of
pictorial beauties, and the brilliancy of sunshine. The atmosphere,
which becomes most visible when before shadows, is frequently so much
illuminated by the sun's rays, as to make the shadows appear nearly
equally light with the illuminated parts of the objects; and the only
distinction between the lights and shadows is to be found in the
difference of tint&#8212;the shadows being blue or purple, and the lights a
warm yellow, or fleshy colour.
</p>

<p>
The practice in art, both in Oil and in Water colours, has been an
imitation of the process of nature, and with similar results. It is
usual in Oil to paint the distance stronger in colour than it is
intended to remain, and when dry, to pass some very thin opaque colour
(technically to scumble) over the whole. Thus the most perfectly aerial
tints are produced. In Water Colours, owing to the different quality of
the materials employed, another method is adopted. White, or any opaque
pigment (except when used in conjunction with Oil painting), has a
disagreeable effect; so it is considered advisable partially to wash
out the too highly coloured distance, and aerial tints similar to those
produced by the scumble are obtained.
</p>

<p>
However requisite it may be philosophically to account for these
appearances, it is unnecessary to perplex the reader of the present
work with a questionable statement of the greater impetus of rays of
certain colours enabling them to penetrate through the dense
atmosphere, while others are more feeble, and are swallowed up and
absorbed by the medium through which they in vain essay to pass. This
may be a very pretty story to amuse children with, and such
philosophers as are verging on their second childhood; but while so
simple a method can be discovered of accounting for the blueness of the
sky and distant objects, and one that can be so easily exemplified as
that given in the previous pages, we shall not be the parties to
contribute to that amusement, by writing "the history of some blue rays
that were lost in a fog." Nor is this the place to point out the
absurdity of such theories; it will be sufficient to remark that
<i>if</i> they are correct, all distant objects must appear <i>red</i>;
and the blueness of the sky can only be accounted for by the
hypothesis, that the atmosphere is a sort of trap for the blue rays of
all the light that has passed and is passing through it!
</p>

<p>
Such being the effect of the atmosphere, and such being the
antagonizing influence of Association in looking at Nature, it has been
found necessary for the purposes of Art, in representation, to
exaggerate the former, to overstep the modesty of Nature, and thus to
produce what may be termed conventional imitations or translations of
Nature.
</p>

<p>
For, in looking at a picture, Association again affects us; and as we
know what is before us to be a flat surface, this can only be overcome
by increasing the effects produced by atmospheric influence,
reflections, refractions, &#38;c. Hence the colour of all distant objects
are reduced to some tone of grey, oscillating between the extremes of
bright blue or even purple, and the medium between black and white as
the subject, may be in sunshine cold daylight; or, as the taste of the
artist may lead him to prefer one scale of colouring to another. Those
who delight in the sunny skies of Italy, or tropical climates,
represent the distance by the purest blue that Ultramarine affords.
Others, who delineate the village church or cathedral tower, represent
them of a dark grey. Mountain scenery is represented of a deep Indigo
blue, sometimes inclining to a decided purple, as all must remember in
the drawings of the late Mr. Robson.
</p>

<p>
If this exaggeration or pictorial license be objected to, as an
unnecessary departure from truth or the beauty of Nature, let the most
inveterate worshipper of verisimilitude place himself before a
landscape under bright sunshine, on a clear day, and make an exact
representation, if he be able, of what he sees; and he will be
convinced that in such an instance, something more and very different
is required, to make a finely coloured picture. It cannot be that the
colours of the original are deficient in beauty, but that an essential
quality of the beauty of Nature cannot be preserved by Imitative Art.
He will find that it will not be possible to preserve even slightly the
gradation of tints before him, without descending almost to blackness
in the shadows, which will be destructive of brilliancy of sunshine,
and at the same time, of that quality which is indispensable in a work
of Art, <i>breadth</i>. He will find that in comparison with the
brightness of the sky, the trees will look as dark as they are
represented by Ruysdael and Hobbima, but who incontestibly do not give
the idea of sunshine. As in translating from one language to another,
he will find that a literal version may give the bones, but not the
spirit of the text; and that something more is required to transfer the
full force and character of the original. Herein consists a great part
of the art of colouring objects. It may be that the scene being
unbounded in Nature, is acted upon by extraneous circumstances which
cannot be called to the aid of a picture.
</p>

<p>
As it is impossible with pigments to rival the brightness of light, it
has been found necessary to adopt some method of forcing the effect of
colours, so as to conceal or to supply a compensation for this
deficiency, and <i>apparently</i> to produce the vigour of truth.
</p>

<p>
This has led to a division, which rivals in fierceness as in name, the
feud of the Bianchi and the Neri of Italy, into two great schisms or
factions of colourists, of whom, it is to be regretted, too many are
apt to consider those of the opposite party as lost in the depths of
absurdity. The hostility and contempt are quite mutual, and equally
ungrounded.
</p>

<p>
A writer in Blackwood's Magazine of the Neri faction says, "We have
received a prescriptive right to make war upon the rising heresy of
light pictures, and we will wage it to the knife," or some such
expressions.
</p>

<p>
Certain tones of colour have been found to be almost universally
recognized as agreeables; and by the above mentioned class of artists
and critics, the Neri, it is held to be "fine colouring," to reduce
every representation, without consideration of propriety, to these
conventionally agreeable tones. Plate. Sir Joshua Reynolds commends a
picture of a moonlight scene by Rubens, which is so rich in colour,
that if you hide the moon it appears like a sunset.
</p>

<p>
The background of the far-famed Mercury, Venus and Cupid, by Corregio,
in the National Gallery, and the sky of the Bacchus and Ariadne, by
Titian, in the same collection, are instances of this practice, the use
of conventionally agreeable tones, which may be seen by every one. It
would be difficult to say what the former was meant for, except
<i>background</i> to the figures; and no one ever saw a sky such a blue
as the latter. It irresistibly brings to mind the counter-criticism of
a sceptic to the admiration of a landscape by Poussin, in which Sir
&#8212;&#8212;, a worshipper of the old masters, was indulging:&#8212;"What I like so
much is, it looks so <i>like</i> an <i>old picture</i>."&#8212;"Yes," said
the sceptic, "and the <i>sky</i> looks as <i>old</i> as the <i>rest</i>
of the <i>picture</i>, for you never see such a sky now-a-days."
</p>

<p>
The Neri apparently give up all hope of rivalling the brightness of
nature; but by forcing the shadows and general tone of the whole
picture, endeavour to produce the same <i>gradation</i> of light and
shadow as in nature, but on a lower scale.
</p>

<p>
The Bianchi party, on the other hand, endeavour to compensate for the
want of positive brilliancy, by refining or increasing the delicacy and
beauty of the tints.
</p>

<p>
Light is the origin, or immediate cause of <i>colour</i>, and the
brighter the light, the greater variety of tints will be found or
displayed. As we cannot rival the cause, the Bianchi contend that we
must increase the effect by introducing <i>colour</i> in lieu of those
<i>tints</i> which in nature appear neutral; and thus conceal the
weakness of our imitation of the cause, by making it apparently produce
greater effects. Thus all greys are rendered by pure Ultramarine blue
tints, or delicate pearly purple, and the greatest possible variety of
beautiful and delicate colours are introduced in the light; while the
shadows are generally of a neutral colour, the most decidedly
contrasting with the tints in the light. But sometimes the colour is
also carried through the shadows as well as the lights; positive
crimson being introduced into those of leaves or grass; while those of
flesh are rendered by a dull red; and those of a sandy bank by pure
blue. Plate.
</p>

<p>
The Neri complain that the Bianchi want tone, and the Bianchi that the
Neri want purity and light.
</p>

<p>
Each of these factions contends, that all the difficulty of fine
colouring is to be found only in their own aim; while they hold in
perfect contempt the productions of their opponents, as being of such
facile achievement as to the sarcasm of Michael Angelo,&#8212;to be "fit
only for children," and beneath the attention of those who profess to
study the Fine Arts.
</p>

<div class="figcenter2"><a name="neri"><img src="images/013.jpg" alt="THE NERI" width="550" height="368"></a></div>
<p class="caption">THE NERI
</p>

<p>
The main difference between the principles of these two parties or
factions, will be found to lie in the treatment of the atmospheric
influence and association, previously alluded to. The Bianchi availing
themselves of the former circumstance, as a reason for introducing a
great variety of pearly greys, on the purity and beauty of which they
contend fine colouring is dependent; and the Neri availing themselves
of the latter, as an excuse for the introduction of breadth of warm
tones, and the omission of as much as possible of the cool tints, which
are deemed so indispensable by their rivals; they limit the
representation of atmospheric influence to the least possible degree.
Titian's Venuses are masses of the local colour of flesh, broken with
so little half-tint, that they are scarcely round, and satisfy few but
critics sufficiently learned in the Art, to be contented with the
beauties of <i>Art</i>, as a substitute for the imitation of
<i>Nature</i>.
</p>

<p>
This class of colouring is founded upon the power of Association,
previously alluded to, by which, the local colour overpowers the greys
of atmospheric influence; in other words, that to the eyes of the many,
<i>flesh</i> looks of a <i>flesh</i> colour, and ought to be so
represented. But the <i>full</i> effect of Association is here not
allowed for. In looking at flesh, we know it to be flesh colour; and we
know it to be round; and it requires some education of the eye to
discover the atmospheric influence, as well as the minute gradations in
form. But on the other hand, in looking at a picture, we know it to be
a flat surface; and however far the <i>imagination</i> may be willing
or have a tendency to supply the deficiencies in the representation,
<i>Association</i> is an <i>antagonist</i> and not an ally. This will
become evident upon making outlines of objects and filling them up with
flat tints; imagination will not have power to make them appear to be
round, or to recede. The beauties of this class of colouring are solely
conventional.
</p>

<p>
Titian, Giorgione, and Sir Joshua Reynolds lead the van of the Neri;
Rubens, Vandyke, and Lawrence are at the head of the Bianchi; unless,
indeed, we should consider Turner as general-in-chief of the latter.
Claude was probably of the Bianchi faction; but Time, who is the great
ally of the Neri, has made him appear in some of his productions an
adherent of that party.
</p>

<p>
It may be added, that most historical painters lean to the Neri
faction, on account of the disadvantage arising from too close an
approach to the common appearance of every-day nature, of which the
effect is described in the proverb, that "familiarity breeds contempt,"
and consequently is destructive of that grandeur, solemnity, or
refinement which is indispensable in high art; and they take refuge in
the "cloistered tone" of Ludovico Caracci, so commended by Sir Joshua
Reynolds, a conventional beauty which will presently be noticed. The
Landscape painters, on the other hand, almost universally belong to the
Bianchi party; as truth or <i>apparent</i> truth is so much more
indispensable in subjects that only display the scenery of nature, and
which depend upon that resemblance for producing an impression, than in
subjects which appeal to the passions by the display of some stirring
incident. From the nature of the materials employed, the tendency of
oil painting is to the side of the Neri; whilst the general inclination
induced by Water-colour drawing, is in favour of the Bianchi party. The
<i>alleged</i> principle of the colouring of the Neri is deduced from
the hypothesis laid down by Sir Isaac Newton, that neither white nor
black are <i>colours</i>, therefore say the Neri, "neither should
appear in a finely coloured picture; the brightest lights should not be
white; the deepest shadows should not be black;" nevertheless, those
productions which are cited by this party as the finest specimens of
colour in existence, <i>do</i> contain both <i>white</i> and
<i>black</i>. In the celebrated picture by Giorgione, copied recently
by Mr. Ward, R.A., to the eye of the uninitiated are presented both
white lights, and black shadows. The former, it is true, are reduced by
<i>Time</i> or glazing; and the latter are excused as having lost their
original colour.
</p>

<p>
But this principle can scarcely be said to be carried out, except in
such pictures as possess the "cloistered tone" of Ludovico Caracci
alluded to. Here the lights are warm and golden, as if transmitted
through stained glass. The atmospheric greys are introduced to no
greater extent than is indispensable to prevent the picture appearing
rusty. The shadows are deep rich browns, into which are thrown still
warmer reflections; and the whole picture is subdued to a
soft-mysterious effect, which is admirably adapted to produce what is
technically termed <i>repose</i>, and to excite gentle, reverential,
solemn, and even affectionate feelings. It is a style of colouring
peculiarly suited to religious subjects; and in representations of
interiors, may be said to be like nature, because Nature <i>may</i> be
made to appear like it. (<i>See Plate.</i>)
</p>

<div class="figcenter2"><a name="bianchi"><img src="images/014.jpg" alt="THE BIANCHI" width="525" height="377"></a></div>
<p class="caption">THE BIANCHI
</p>

<p>
This principle of colouring may be carried out on a higher scale than
is generally found among the productions of its advocates, and
abstractedly, is undoubtedly calculated to lead to very beautiful
results; though it may be questioned, whether it is sufficient to
entitle the party exclusively to arrogate to themselves the designation
of <i>colourists</i>, as they are in the habit of doing. For the
principle of the Bianchi is likewise adapted to produce exceedingly
beautiful colouring; and without some rational or scientific standard
by which the comparative beauty of individual colours may be
determined, so as to distinguish between fine colours and fine
colouring, the admirers of this class of colours may, with the greatest
justice, contend that it is equally beautiful with that of the opposite
party; while it has this superiority, that it will enable the Artist to
produce much more resemblance in the representation of <i>external</i>
nature, and will be much less artificial in the effects produced as
imitation of interiors.
</p>

<p>
And they derive a strong argument in favour of their mode of proceeding
being correct, and most likely to stand, from the circumstance, that
the pictures of Vandyke, many of which are <i>now</i> claimed by the
Neri as painted on their principle, when first done were frequently
censured as being too <i>raw</i> or <i>white</i>.
</p>

<p>
Further, it should be observed that, by too many of the Neri party,
their great object of worship, <i>Tone</i>, is limited to the rich warm
brownish yellow which is legitimately superinduced in oil pictures by
the action of Time, or glazing; and surreptitiously obtained by washing
with tobacco-water. But an inspection of the works of the Dutch school,
who belong to a third party which considers both the Bianchi and Neri
to be in the wrong, as too artificial, will show that <i>tone</i> may
be cool as well as warm, and that there is a silvery <i>tone</i> which
has as devoted admirers as those of the Golden Image&#8212;(<i>see Plates of
Ruysdael and of Ostade</i>).
</p>

<div class="figcenter2"><a name="dutch"><img src="images/015.jpg" alt="THE DUTCH SCHOOL" width="500" height="372"></a></div>
<p class="caption">THE DUTCH SCHOOL
</p>

<p>
It may not be becoming in the author of the present work to decide
between these great disputants; but from the statement respecting
Vandyke's pictures, that they were considered <i>raw</i> when fresh
painted, as well as from the nature of the materials employed, it is
evident, that the productions of Titian, Giorgione, and other
celebrated colourists, were not, when first painted, of such deep tones
as they exhibit now; and it may be suspected that the reputation, which
was derived from the <i>original</i> colouring of their pictures, has,
to a certain extent, been attached to the colouring they at present
exhibit; and that veneration of talent, and respect for authority, have
given sanction to what would be repudiated by the Great men whose names
form the slogan of the party, and is not really entitled to
commendation.
</p>

<p>
That the two principles may be combined, and so produce higher
qualities than either affords alone, is hardly possible, when their
opposite treatment of the effects of atmospheric influence and
association are taken into consideration.
</p>

<p>
But this compromise may be made between them with advantage both to
Amateurs and Artists; that the style of the Neri, including that of the
Dutch school, may be considered as most applicable to the
representation of interiors and quiet or grand subjects; while that of
the Bianchi may be considered as most suited to exteriors, and subjects
of gaiety and animation.
</p>

<p>
For the benefit of the Amateur, it will be necessary to say something
more upon the style of colouring adopted by the Dutch school, the
productions of which among the cognoscenti, are termed pictures of
<i>Tone</i>; tone being in this instance used in opposition to positive
colour, and as implying varieties of the ternary combinations, called
neutral tints, or greys, but otherwise possessing the qualities of tone
in a general sense, namely, transparency.
</p>

<p>
This style of colouring is peculiarly adapted to the class of subjects
on which the Masters of the Dutch school generally exercised their
pencils, homely interiors; but when applied to out-of-door scenes,
although undoubtedly possessed of certain conventional beauties, such
as harmonious arrangement and balance of tones, it has a tendency to
look dull and heavy. The landscapes of Ruysdael and Hobbima do not
reckon among their beauties, that of vivacity or cheerfulness. They may
be clear and bright and fresh, as their admirers say, but they do not
represent Nature under her most bewitching aspect, nor is the style of
the school adapted to do so. It leans to the side of the Neri, from its
dread of brilliant colours. It is unaffected, sober, and in many
instances, such as interiors or close woody scenes under grey daylight,
possesses great truth; but from its limited application, and
unpretending effect, is scarcely to be put into competition, as a style
of Fine Colouring, with the higher aims of the two great parties before
mentioned. Plate.
</p>

<p>
Such is the present state of the theory of Fine Colouring; from which
it is evident, that, except in a very limited class of subjects, Truth
<i>cannot</i> be made the test&#8212;that even in this class of subjects, it
is disputed whether it <i>should</i> be made the test; and that it is
also disputed, to what extent a departure from truth is admissible; or
rather, what quantity of resemblance to Nature is indispensable, and
what method may be the best of compensating the want of accurate
transcription; in short, what is the true <i>idiom</i> of Fine
Colouring in Art, so as fully to translate the beauties of Nature.
</p>

<p>
The fashion of the day rather leans to the Bianchi party in
Water-colour drawings, if not in Oil paintings; but the principles of
<i>none</i> of the parties are <i>fully</i> developed in the works of
their existing followers. The followers of the Dutch school are
sacrificing part of their truth for some, but it may be doubted whether
the best, part of the conventional tones of both the other parties. The
Bianchi are more regardless of truth than they need be, even to
develope their principles to the utmost. And the Neri admit themselves
to be wandering in a maze, without any fixed ideas of their own
principles, and therefore are less frequently successful than the
reverse; and they are equally obnoxious to the charge of departing
farther from truth, than is necessary to give their own principles full
play. Very recently a heresy of this faction adopted a peculiarity of
tone, which is not to be found in the works of any of the great men of
their party; and which is obnoxious to two serious objections. It is a
greenish tone that unavoidably excites the idea of corruption and
decay, which, having a tendency towards the disgusting, is not
tolerable in the Fine Arts; and the second objection is, that, in their
zeal for transparency, they had lost solidity to such an extent, that a
portrait of George IV. by a celebrated artist, had the appearance of a
vision, or of having been spun out of green glass bottles.
</p>

<p>
The beginner and the Amateur have already been warned against the
dangers of green in pictures. And it may now be added, that
transparency should reside in the <i>colours</i> to conceal the
appearance of pigments, but that the substances represented should
appear as <i>solid</i> as in nature.

COLOURS OF LIGHTS AND SHADOWS.
</p>

<p>
Whatever party of Colourists may find favour in the eyes of the reader,
it will be necessary for him to be aware of certain effects observed in
Nature, of which he will make such use as is admissible under the
principle he may adopt.
</p>

<p>
Colours reside in the light parts of objects, if not brightest on the
lightest parts, closely adjacent to them.
</p>

<p>
Shadows reduce, blacken, or render negative the colours of objects. The
edges, extremities, or boundaries of <i>all</i> shadows are
<i>grey</i>.
</p>

<p>
From the effect of contrast, shadows appear <i>comparatively</i> of the
opposite colour to that of the light. The Bianchi take advantage of
this circumstance, and sometimes force or increase the colour of the
shadow, to bring out that of the light without really tinging it so
<i>deeply</i> as is the case in Nature; whereby greater brilliancy is
retained.
</p>

<p>
The colours of the lights and shadows depend upon that of the
illuminating power, whether sunshine, moonlight, or grey daylight.
These will be separately pointed out.
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="sunshine"><img src="images/016.jpg" alt="SUNSHINE" width="540" height="406"></a></div>

<p class="head">
SECTION III.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
SUNSHINE.
</p>

<p>
The degree to which the colours of objects will be affected by that of
the source of light, will very much depend upon the strength of the
illuminating power.
</p>

<p>
The light of the noonday sun is so vivid that it diffuses its colour
over all the illumined parts of the objects under its influence. These
assume a rich golden hue, through which the local colours of the
objects are slightly distinguishable, but rather as modifications of
the warm tone diffused by the rays of the sun, than as integral
varieties of tint.
</p>

<p>
As already has been noticed, the obvious effect of a yellowish light
upon a blue object would be to induce a greenish tint; but in the case
of sunshine, this is counteracted by the brilliancy of the light, and
in representation, it is necessary for the same purpose, to infuse
sufficient red into the light of blue objects under the influence of
sunshine, or a disagreeable heavy effect will be produced.
</p>

<p>
Green, yellow, and orange objects become particularly brilliant in
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
The shadows of the foreground are, in Nature, particularly negative or
colourless; but as they recede, become gradually more blue. Sir Joshua
Reynolds has made the shadows on the arm of his Sleeping Girl nearly
black. He is one of the Neri. The Bianchi would have made them partake
more of the colour opposite to that of light, purply brown, broken with
red reflections. The shadows on green objects in the foreground would
be rendered by dark crimson. Sir Thomas Lawrence frequently used pure
lake in the shadows of his grass or shrubs. Plate.

CHAPTER III.
</p>

<p class="head">
SECTION IV.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
SUNSET.
</p>

<p>
At Sunset there is even less variety of colour observable in the
illumined parts of objects than when the sun is higher in the sky. This
arises from the influence of the atmosphere previously alluded to. A
greater quantity of the medium is loaded with light, and the local
colours of the objects seen through it are consequently affected to a
greater degree thereby. The colour of the light is also affected by the
medium through which it passes, and it becomes much richer, and more
nearly approaching to orange.
</p>

<p>
The light in the sky, or illuminating power, is made yellow; but the
lights on objects are rendered of a fleshy colour, which is made to
appear warmer by the opposition of positive purple shadows, while those
objects which do not receive any of the sun's light are kept very cool
grey (the effect of reflected light from the blue sky), which by
contrast throws the whole of the illuminated part of the picture into
warmth. Frontispiece.

SECTION V.
</p>

<p class="subhead">
MOONLIGHT.
</p>

<p>
The light of the moon being white or silvery grey, the shadows are made
comparatively warm browns. The appearance of moonlight is given by the
colours on the illuminated objects in the picture, which are made to
appear cooler than they really are, by the contrast with the warm
shadows. By this means, much more colour may be introduced into the
light than is usually observed in Nature, and without impairing the
effect of moonlight; and the Bianchi contend that by such means greater
brilliancy is obtained. The blues in the sky near the moon are kept
very pure for the same purpose. Plate.
</p>

</p>

<p class="head">
SECTION VI.
</p>

<p class="head">
GREY DAYLIGHT.
</p>

<p>
Grey daylight also affords brownish shadows, but from the greater
quantity and diffusion of comparatively colourless light, the local
colours of objects become more visible, while the shadows are more
varied by reflection and refraction. Reflections take their colours
from those of the objects by which they are occasioned. The lights on
objects are treated as in the case of moonlight; they are made
<i>positively</i> warmer than they appear in nature, and are rendered
<i>comparatively</i> cool by the warmth of the shadows.&#8212;Plate.
</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>
The degrees to which these licences may be carried, must depend upon
the style of colouring adopted. The Amateur has had them placed before
him, and whichever he may choose, he will be certain to meet with
success in the eyes of one party; he cannot hope to please all.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
